"# Rubiks\_Cube\_Solver"



**ðŸ§© Rubik's Cube Solver â€“ Web Application:**

&nbsp;	This project is a Java Spring Boot web application that simulates a 3x3 Rubik's Cube and solves it using the two-phase algorithm.

ðŸ“¦ Features:

&nbsp;	Interactive 3D-like cube UI



&nbsp;	Manual color input and pattern mode



&nbsp;	Pattern presets with predefined cube strings and solutions



&nbsp;	Integration with a backend solving algorithm (two-phase method)



&nbsp;	Responsive and minimal UI
